This document describes our current thinking on two aspects of the [lowRISC](https://www.lowrisc.org)
SoC, namely tagged memory and 'minion' cores usable for I/O and other tasks. 
We are sharing it at this early stage in the spirit of "release early, 
release often" and to benefit from input and ideas from the wider community.
