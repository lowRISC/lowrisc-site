## System requirement

We recommend you work with a 64-bit Ubuntu (14.04 LTS) system with GNU GCC >= 4.8 installed. If necessary, create such a setup using [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player/) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

The default simulator for RTL/Behavioural SystemVerilog simulation is [Verilator](http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator).
Please download and install a latest version for the best SystemVerilog support.

An FPGA demonstration is provided using either a [Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA KC705 evaluation kit](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html) or a low-end [Nexys™4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA Board](http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/). The KC705 kit comes with a device and node locked license for [Xilinx Vivado Design Suite](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html). The default version for FPGA demonstration project is Vivado 2015.3(64-bit). As for the users of the Nexys4-DDR boards, please acquire a free license and install the WebPACK edition of Vivado.

By default, all simulations produce waveforms in the VCD format.  
[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) can be used to view VCD files.

Here shows software versions and environment variables on my machine:

     # it is better to use bash

Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed before attempting
to build the RISC-V tools:

    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl \
      libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison \
      flex texinfo gperf libncurses5-dev libusb-1.0-0 libboost-dev

## Download the code release

The [lowRISC chip git repository](https://github.com/lowrisc/lowrisc-chip) is 
hosted on GitHub . Instead of cloning individual sub-modules, we recommend
cloning the entire repository to ensure all the sub-modules you
acquire are compatible. Different versions of the sub-modules are not
guaranteed to work.

To clone the whole lowRISC chip git repository:

    # clone the repository to your home directory:
    cd ~/lowRISC/DIR
    git clone https://github.com/lowrisc/lowrisc-chip.git
    cd lowrisc-chip
    git checkout untether-v0.2
    git submodule update --init --recursive

There are 3 main branches:

 * *master* : The major release branch, default, most stable. After major releases, only bugfixes related to the latest release are merged.
 * *dev* : The minor release branch, less stable. After major releases, new features are added to this branch waiting for the next major release.
 * *update* : The active development branch, non-stable. The branch for 
 developing new features, testing bugfixes, and experimenting with new ideas.

To setup the necessary RISC-V variables use the setup script
found at `lowrisc-chip/set_riscv_env.sh`:

    # source this file
    echo "Setting up lowRISC/RISC-V environment..."
    echo "Make sure you source this script at the top of lowrisc-chip."
    # Variables for lowRISC/RISC-V
    if [ "$TOP" == "" ]; then
        echo "\$TOP is not available."
        echo "Set \$TOP to the top of lowrisc-chip which is the current directory."
        export TOP=$PWD
    fi
    export RISCV=$TOP/riscv
    export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV/bin
    # choose the FPGA board (KC705 in default)
    export FPGA_BOARD=kc705
