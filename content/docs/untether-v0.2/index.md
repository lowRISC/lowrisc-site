**Release version 0.2** (12-2015)

## Introduction

[lowRISC][lowRISC] is a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to
produce a fully open source System-on-Chip (SoC) in volume. We are
building upon RISC-V processor core implementations from the RISC-V
team at UC Berkeley.  We will produce a SoC design to populate a
low-cost community development board and to act as an ideal starting
point for derivative open-source and commercial designs.

This tutorial introduces a standalone implementation of the [Rocket chip][RocketChip].
The original Rocket chip relies on a companion processor
for accessing peripheral devices and I/O. This design replaces the companion
processor with actual peripheral devices on FPGA providing an 'untethered'
SoC that is able to boot a [RISC-V Linux][RISCVLinux]. A demo is provided using
either a [Xilinx Kintex-7 KC705 evaluation kit]
(http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-k7-kc705-g.html)
or a low-end [Nexys™4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA Board]
(http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-4-ddr-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/).

Please note that this release is based on recent upstream Rocket-chip sources 
and therefore it does not currently include the tagged memory support provided 
in our previous release. We plan to re-integrate tagged memory support with 
additional optimisations in the early half of next year.

The tutorial also acts as an introduction to the RISC-V tools and provides
a step-by-step guide to setting up the environment necessary to run
test programs either in simulation or on an FPGA.
