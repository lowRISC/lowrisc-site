**Release version 0.5** (12-2017)

## Introduction

[lowRISC][lowRISC] is a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to
produce a fully open source System-on-Chip (SoC) in volume. We are
building upon RISC-V processor core implementations from the RISC-V
team at UC Berkeley. We will produce a SoC design to populate a
low-cost community development board and to act as an ideal starting
point for derivative open-source and commercial designs.

This tutorial adds further functionality towards the final SoC design:

* A simple 100Mbps Ethernet capability.
* Remote booting via Ethernet from a Linux server.
* Preview of interrupt driven device drivers in Linux.
* Optimised SD-interface
* Console defaults to keyboard and optimised VGA-compatible text display.
* Network filing system (NFS) support in the RISCV kernel and NFS-root support scripts.
* Multiuser system leveraging the poky Linux build system.

The build environment and pre-built images support the same platform as the previous releases, a competitively priced
