+++
  

  lowRISC is creating a fully open-sourced, Linux-capable, RISC-V-based
  SoC, that can be used either directly or as the basis for a custom design.
  We aim to complete our SoC design this year.

  Our open-source SoC (System-on-a-Chip)
  designs will be based on the 64-bit [RISC-V](http://riscv.org/) instruction
  set architecture. Volume silicon manufacture is planned
  as is a low-cost development board.
  
  lowRISC is a not-for-profit organisation working closely with the University
  of Cambridge and the open-source community.

### Recent milestones

**Jan 2018**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/ethernet-v0.5/index.md" 
>}}) focusing on the integration of open source Ethernet IP.

**May 2017**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/minion-v0.4/index.md" 
>}}) brings back tagged memory with builtin support in Rocket core and has a minion driven SD.

**July 2016**: New lowRISC [code release]({{< ref "docs/debug-v0.3/index.md" 
>}}) including support for trace debug.

**June 2016**: Presented a brief [tutorial at 
DAC](http://www2.dac.com/events/eventdetails.aspx?id=200-28) on prototyping 
RISC-V SoCs using lowRISC and Xilinx FPGAs.

**June 2016**: We were thrilled to be given five student slots in the 2016 
Google Summer of code. See 
[here](https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2016/06/lowriscs-2016-google-summer-of-code-students/)
for more information about their projects.

**Dec 2015:** We have 
[untethered](https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release/)
the Rocket SoC, which now runs standalone on the KC705 and Nexys4DDR FPGAs.
This release also includes support for simulation using Verilator and is 
accompanied by [extensive documentation]({{< ref "docs/untether-v0.2/index.md" 
>}}).


### The Team

lowRISC was founded by:

* Robert Mullins - Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, co-founder of Raspberry Pi
* Gavin Ferris - Dreamworks, Radioscape (co-founder), Aspect Capital (former CIO)
* Alex Bradbury - Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge and Raspberry Pi

In addition to the above, the core development team at the University of 
Cambridge Computer Laboratory is comprised of:

* Wei Song
* Jonathan Kimmitt

We are also grateful to our collaborators elsewhere in the community, as well 
as the undergraduates, graduate students, and interns who have contributed.
