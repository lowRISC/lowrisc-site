  lowRISC is producing fully open hardware systems. From the processor core
  to the development board, our goal is to create a completely open computing
  eco-system.

  Our open-source SoC (System-on-a-Chip)
  designs will be based on the 64-bit [RISC-V](http://riscv.org/) instruction
  set architecture. Volume silicon manufacture is planned
  as is a low-cost development board. There are more details on our plans in 
    [these slides from a recent 
    talk](https://speakerdeck.com/asb/lowrisc-the-path-to-an-open-source-soc)

  lowRISC is a not-for-profit organisation working closely with the University
  of Cambridge and the open-source community.

### Recent milestones<

*May 2015:* This summer we have [six students working on Summer of Code projects](http://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/05/summer-of-code-students-for-lowrisc/). The coding period is from the end of May to the end of August.

*Apr 2015:* We have shared our first [lowRISC preview release](http://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/04/lowrisc-tagged-memory-preview-release/), demonstrating support for tagged memory as described in [our memo]("http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/memo-2014-001-tagged-memory-and-minion-cores"/). This FPGA-compatible code release is accompanied by an [extensive tutorial](http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/tutorial/).

*Mar 2015:* We are excited to announce we are taking part in the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) 2015.  See our [ideas list](http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/gsoc-2015-ideas/) for a wide range of projects in different languages and covering pretty much every level of the hardware/software stack.

*Dec 2014:* We have now released a document describing our plans for [tagged memory and minion cores in the lowRISC SoC](http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/memo-2014-001-tagged-memory-and-minion-cores/)
