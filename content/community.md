# Keep up to date with lowRISC
The best ways of keeping up with lowRISC developments are:

 * Check our [blog](http://lowrisc.org/blog), and subscribe to [the RSS feed](https://www.lowrisc.org/index.xml).

 * Follow [@lowRISC on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lowRISC)

 * Sign up to our announcement mailing list:
  <form class="subscribe-form" action="http://subscribe.lowrisc.org/subscribe" method="post">
    <input name="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" required>

  </form>

### Mailing lists
Development discussion takes place on the lowrisc-dev mailing list. Archives are [here](https://listmaster.pepperfish.net/pipermail/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org/) and you can [subscribe here](http://listmaster.pepperfish.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lowrisc-dev-lists.lowrisc.org). There’s also relevant discussion on the [RISC-V mailing lists](http://riscv.org/mailing-lists/).

We used to use IRC (#lowRISC on irc.oftc.net) but mostly don’t now. We have an open group chat on [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/), which [community members are welcome to join](https://lowrisc.zulipchat.com/register/).

### Source code
You can find source code for lowRISC projects on [our GitHub organisation page](https://github.com/lowrisc). We're also active on the upstreams of a range of other projects such as LLVM and the Ariane RISC-V core design.

# The lowRISC community
The lowRISC community has always worked to be a welcoming and respectful community, and we want to ensure that doesn’t change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:

 * be friendly and patient,

 * be welcoming,

 * be considerate,

 * be respectful,

 * be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others, and

 * when we disagree, try to understand why.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.
