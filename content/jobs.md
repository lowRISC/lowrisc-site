## lowRISC is hiring
lowRISC C.I.C. is a not-for-profit company that aims to demonstrate, promote and support the use of open-source hardware - bringing the benefits of open-source to the hardware world. We are producing high-quality, security-focused, open, and flexible IP.

We are currently growing our team to deliver on an exciting, high impact, open source hardware roadmap in collaboration with Google and other industry partners.

You can get a sense of some of our activities from [the lowRISC GitHub repo](https://github.com/lowRISC), and our open source RISC-V core [Ibex](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex) is in active development. Our mission is to make open hardware a reality at scale, and that means making pragmatic choices in what we do. Some of our work is embargoed for now. This enables us to host high potential projects which advance our mission. All our engineering work will be open source later. 

All our open roles are [listed here](https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/) for online applications.

We always welcome speculative applications from skilled engineers who feel they could contribute to lowRISC (even when none of our open roles are suitable). Please [apply](https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/apply/NHq7IqDaqL/Speculative-Applications-General) - and explain in a covering letter how your skills and experience could make a difference at lowRISC. These speculative applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis and unsuccessful applications may not be acknowledged.

This is a great time to join our growing team and be part of the open source silicon revolution. We’re based in [a friendly innovation space](https://www.ideaspace.cam.ac.uk/) in the beautiful city of Cambridge, UK, near the University of Cambridge’s [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cst.cam.ac.uk). Cambridge is home to a varied and lively tech cluster, arguably the most successful in Europe with more than 1,500 high-tech companies based in the area, employing more than 54,000 people.

All [our roles](https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/) are exciting positions for skilled engineers who will appreciate the freedom to explore and invent in the open. lowRISC also provides the opportunity to work within a team exploring the full hardware/software stack on a broad range of challenging projects.  

You’ll be joining a team with expertise including processor and SoC design, with a particular focus on  hardware security, design verification, RISC-V tools, and the LLVM compiler. We're not big on job titles, and as a small, growing organisation many of us have overlapping skills and we each contribute where we can to our projects.

lowRISC culture is respectful, inclusive and professional. We’re in a ‘startup-style’ growth phase with some big and exciting projects underway, whilst strengthening and retaining the flexible, supportive and cheerful work environment which makes lowRISC a great place to work. We’re building our team in Cambridge, working in the same place most of the time, whilst welcoming flexible working.

If you’ve got any questions about working at lowRISC C.I.C., the application process, or about specific roles, get in touch with the team at hiring@lowrisc.org
