Yesterday, lowRISC triggered a lot of discussion when someone submitted it to 
Hacker News. The [comment 
thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13129076) became something of an 
impromptu Q+A about our project direction and status. I thought it was worth 
linking to it here and highlighting the discussion for a wider audience. If 
you have any additional questions, then feel free to comment on this blog post 
or else, as always, drop by our [mailing list]({{< ref "community.md" >}}).
